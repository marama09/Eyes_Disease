## 1.	Introduction:
 This is the fifth T5 Data Science Bootcamp project, which is about deep learning and building classification models that address a useful prediction and/or interpretation problem using Python with Sklearn. Below are details about an eye disease classification for a hospital in Saudi Arabia that we are collaborating with to help them solve their problem and describe the dataset and tools we will be using for the project.
