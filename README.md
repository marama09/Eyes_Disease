## 1.	Introduction:
 This is the fifth T5 Data Science Bootcamp project, which is about deep learning and building classification models that address a useful prediction and/or interpretation problem using Python with Sklearn. Below are details about an eye disease classification for a hospital in Saudi Arabia that we are collaborating with to help them solve their problem and describe the dataset and tools we will be using for the project.
  
## 2.	Problem Statement
 In this project, based on the diagnosis of the left and right eye diseases which they were classified into 8 classes. When you enter a picture of a patient's eye,     a prediction will be made to know what the diagnosis is for the patient.

## 3.	Dataset
  The dataset is [Eyes Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k) from Kaggle Website, it contains 6392 rows and 19 columns. For a better understanding of the database there is the description of a column below:
| Variable	    | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ID	   | Unique ID. |
| Patient Age	| the Age of Patient  |
| Patient Sex	 | the Sex of Patient  |
| Left-Fundus	| The patient's left eye|
| Right-Fundus	| IThe patient's right eye |
| Left-Diagnostic Keywords	| Keywords diagnosis of the left eye |
| Right-Diagnostic Keywords |	Keywords diagnosis of the right eye |
| N	| Normal |
| D |	Diabetes|
| G	| Glaucoma| 
| C	| Cataract| 
| A	| Age related Macular Degeneration| 
| H	| Hypertension| 
| M	| Pathological Myopia|   
| O	| Other diseases/abnormalities| 
| filepath	| file path of the picture|
| labels	| disease classification|
| target	| the target disease classification| 
| filename	| name of the picture | 
  
## 4.	Tools 
 These are the technologies and libraries that we will be using for this project:
* Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebook. 
* Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, plotly, Scikit-learn.
