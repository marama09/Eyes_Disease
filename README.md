## 1.	Introduction:
 This is the fifth T5 Data Science Bootcamp project, which is about deep learning and building classification models that address a useful prediction and/or interpretation problem using Python with Sklearn. Below are details about an eye disease classification for a hospital in Saudi Arabia that we are collaborating with to help them solve their problem and describe the dataset and tools we will be using for the project.
  
## 2.	Problem Statement


## 3.	Dataset
  The dataset is [Eyes Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k) from Kaggle Website, it contains 8068 rows and 11 columns. For a better understanding of the database there is the description of a column below:
| Variable	    | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ID	   | Unique ID. |
| Patient Age	|  |
| Patient Sex	 | Marital status of the customer. |
| Left-Fundus	| Age of the customer.|
| Right-Fundus	| Is the customer a graduate?. |
| Left-Diagnostic Keywords	| Profession of the customer. |
| Right-Diagnostic Keywords |	Work Experience in years. |
| N	| Normal |
| D |	Diabetes|
| G	| Glaucoma|

| M	| Pathological Myopia|   
| O	| Other diseases/abnormalities| 
| filepath	| Cataract|
| labels	| Cataract|
| target	| Cataract| 
| filename	| Cataract| 
  
## 4.	Tools 
 These are the technologies and libraries that we will be using for this project:
* Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebook. 
* Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, plotly, Scikit-learn.
